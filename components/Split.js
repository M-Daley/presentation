                    <h3>Translation Between "Math" and "English"</h3>
                    <p>Literacy in mathematics is important because math without context is meaningless. Of the many skills required to be literate in math, we will be exploring the skill of translating between mathematical language and the English language. This will focus on math-specific language and the challenges that come with it.</p>

                    <h3>Importance of Communication</h3>
                    <p>Building on the first section, we will be discussing why it is important to be able to express our ideas. Language and literacy development can only occur after numerous opportunities for students to engage in a mathematics conversation, which is the focus of this section.</p>

                    <h3>Examples of Classroom Application</h3>
                    <p>In this last section, we will be discussing specific examples of how to apply some of the findings in our own classrooms. By applying these methods and strategies, we can help students develop their comprehension and communication skills, as well as develop schema of mathematical concepts rather than pure memorization.</p>
