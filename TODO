Components/Audio/Slider.js
    * Current Error: Resizing window causes AudioProgressBar to maintain it's current width instead of adjusting to fit container
        ❌ Add resize listener on document in order to adjust width of AudioProgressBar along side the newly resized screen.
        ✅ Fixed issue with thumb positioning causing progressbar styling to begin at the left of the component instead of right.

Components/Audio/Button.js
    * Pause Styling stays after the mp3 has ended. Reset the styling and "isPlaying" when the mp3 is over.
        ✅ Fixed by adding a useEffect onto the percentage property and toggling "isPlaying" once it's reached 100

Styles/globas.css > Audio
    * Color of Pause/Play Button does not go well with all backgrounds
        ✅ Changed color too the new --clr-neutral-000; a darker black that shows more promantly on current background colors.
        ✅ Changed color of the progressbar well to match the color text.
